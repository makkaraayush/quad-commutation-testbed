# How I Built My Custom LoRa Telemetry, Ground HUD & Live Video System

Commercial drone telemetry radios (like SiK 433/915MHz sets or RFD900 links) and dedicated 5.8GHz FPV video gear (VTX, receivers, FPV goggles/screens) are way too expensive. I'm building this 500mm quad on a student budget, and dropping $150 to $300 on commercial ground station equipment just wasn't an option.

Instead of giving up on telemetry or waiting until I can save up money, I decided to build my own system from scratch for under $15 using off-the-shelf microcontrollers. 

Here is the complete walkthrough of how I designed it, how I'm wiring everything up, and how you can replicate it step-by-step.

### Why this setup is so practical:
* **Long-Range Telemetry (1–2 km):** Telemetry packets (attitude, GPS coordinates, battery voltage, flight mode, satellites) travel over punchy 433 MHz LoRa between two cheap Ra-02 modules.
* **Bluetooth to Phone (Keeps Mobile Data Active!):** Instead of using Wi-Fi for telemetry (which disables your phone's mobile data), the Ground ESP32 forwards MAVLink over Bluetooth Classic SPP (`Drone_Telemetry`). Your phone's 4G/5G data stays completely active, meaning live Google/Mapbox satellite maps load smoothly in QGroundControl.
* **Glanceable Transmitter HUD:** The 0.96" OLED screen sits right on the top face of my FlySky FS-i6, so I can see my flight mode, battery percentage, altitude, and satellite lock with a quick glance without pulling my phone out.
* **Close-Range Live Video (30–50 m):** When the quad is close by during takeoff, hover, or landing, I can connect to the ESP32-CAM's Wi-Fi hotspot on any browser and see live video from the OV2640 camera.

## 2. Parts List & Hardware

### Drone Air Unit (On Drone)
* 1x AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM (with OV2640 camera module)

---

## 3. Physical Placement & Hardware Mounting

### On the 500mm Quad:
* **ESP32-CAM:** Mounted on the front nose / upper deck of the frame using double-sided foam tape to absorb motor vibrations. The camera lens is angled slightly downward (~10 to 15 degrees) so the horizon is centered during forward pitch.
* **Ra-02 Module:** Mounted on the rear top deck, well away from the high-current battery leads and PDB to keep RF noise low.
* **Air Antenna:** Solder a 16.4 cm wire directly to the **ANT pad on the Ra-02 module**. Route this wire **facing straight UP** (supported inside a plastic straw or attached to a small vertical zip tie). Keeping it pointing UP prevents it from dragging on the ground during landings or getting caught in obstacles.

### On the FlySky FS-i6 Transmitter:
* **ESP32 DevKit & Ra-02:** Mounted neatly on the rear casing or upper handle area of the radio using double-sided foam tape or a lightweight project box.
* **0.96" OLED Display (JMD0.96D-1):** Mounted on the top-front faceplate of the FS-i6 (just above the factory LCD screen or between the top toggle switches) where it is directly in your line of sight without interfering with the stick gimbals.
* **1S 520mAh LiPo & TP4056 Charger:** Mounted on the rear casing. The Type-C charging port is positioned facing outward on the side or bottom edge so you can easily plug in a phone charger cable.
* **Ground Station Power Switch (Where to put it):**
  - **Recommended Spot:** Place the small slide switch on the **top-right rear shoulder** (near the base of the handle / top-right corner of the rear module casing).
  - *Why this spot is ideal:*
    1. **Zero accidental bump risk:** Your palms wrap around the side grips of the FS-i6, while your fingers rest on the front switches. Having the slide switch on the top-right rear shoulder keeps it completely safe from accidental nudges while flying.
    2. **Quick index-finger access:** You can easily flick it ON or OFF with your right index finger without having to flip the transmitter around.
    3. **Short, tidy wiring:** It sits just an inch away from both the TP4056 board and the ESP32 `VIN` pin, keeping your power leads neat and short.
* **Ground Antenna:** Solder a 16.4 cm wire to the **ANT pad of the ground Ra-02**, mounted vertically pointing straight UP to match the drone's antenna polarization.

## 4. Ground Station Power, Battery & Charging Setup

This is the most critical part of the ground station build. Here is how I set up the battery, charging, and power switch so it charges cleanly from a standard phone adapter.

### A. The TP4056 3.3k Resistor Modification (CRITICAL FOR 520mAh LIPO)

> [!WARNING]
> Stock TP4056 boards ship from the factory with a **1.2k ohm** SMD resistor at position **R3 / Rprog**, which sets the charging current to **1000 mA (1.0 Amp)**. 
> 
> My ground station battery is only **520mAh**! Charging a 520mAh cell at 1000mA is nearly a 2C charge rate, which will overheat the battery, cause cell puffing, and ruin it.

The TP4056 charge current formula is:
$$I_{\text{charge}} = \frac{1200\text{V}}{R_{\text{prog}}}$$

* Stock resistor: $R_{\text{prog}} = 1.2\text{k}\Omega \rightarrow I_{\text{charge}} = 1000\text{ mA}$ (Too high!)
* With our 3.3k resistor: $R_{\text{prog}} = 3.3\text{k}\Omega \rightarrow I_{\text{charge}} \approx \mathbf{363\text{ mA}}$

Charging a 520mAh LiPo at ~360mA corresponds to **~0.7C**, which is the gentle, safe, industry-standard charging rate for lithium polymer cells.

#### How to swap the resistor:
1. Look near pin 2 of the TP4056 chip on the board for the small SMD resistor labeled `122` (or marked `R3` / `Rprog`).
2. Touch your soldering iron to both sides to desolder and remove it.
3. Solder your new **3.3k ohm (3k3) 1/4W resistor** across those two pads. If using a through-hole resistor, trim the legs short and solder them flat against the pads.

### B. Wiring the Battery, TP4056, Power Switch & ESP32

Here is the exact circuit diagram for the power section:

              [ESP32 DevKit]
               VIN       GND
```

#### Step-by-Step Power Connections:
1. **Battery to TP4056:**
   - Red wire of 1S LiPo (+) -> Solder to **`B+`** pad on TP4056.
   - Black wire of 1S LiPo (-) -> Solder to **`B-`** pad on TP4056.
2. **Ground to ESP32:**
   - Solder a wire from **`OUT-`** on TP4056 directly to a **`GND`** pin on the ESP32 DevKit.
3. **Power Switch to ESP32:**
   - Solder a wire from **`OUT+`** on TP4056 to the center pin of your SPST slide switch.
   - Solder a wire from the other pin of the slide switch to the **`VIN`** (or `5V`) pin on the ESP32 DevKit.
4. **How Charging Works:**
   - Whenever the battery gets low, simply plug any standard Type-C mobile charger cable into the TP4056 port.
   - The **Red LED** on the board lights up while charging.
   - The **Blue / Green LED** lights up when charging is complete (4.20V cut-off).
   - Because the slide switch sits between `OUT+` and the ESP32, you can flip the switch **OFF** while charging so the battery charges cleanly without powering the microcontroller.

### C. Measuring Station Battery Voltage on the OLED (100k / 100k Divider)

The ESP32's internal analog-to-digital converter (ADC) can only safely read up to 3.3V, but a freshly charged 1S LiPo reaches 4.20V. To safely display the battery percentage on our OLED screen:

```text
From Slide Switch (Switched Bat +) 
          |
          v
   [100k Resistor]
          |
          +-----> Connected directly to ESP32 Pin GPIO 34
          |
   [100k Resistor]
          |
          v
      ESP32 GND
```

* This 1:1 voltage divider cuts the voltage exactly in half (4.20V becomes 2.10V), which GPIO 34 reads safely without any risk of damaging the ESP32.

> [!TIP]
> **Calibrating D34 Voltage Readings to Your Multimeter:**
> Due to the $50\text{k}\Omega$ Thevenin source impedance of the 100k/100k divider combined with the ESP32's internal SAR ADC sample capacitor loading and individual chip Vref tolerances, the raw ADC reading on D34 typically measures slightly lower than actual battery voltage (for example, reading 3.87V when a multimeter measures 4.02V).
>
> In [`src/ground_station_esp32/ground_station_esp32.ino`](file:///d:/MIT/Projects/Drone/quad-commutation-testbed/src/ground_station_esp32/ground_station_esp32.ino) and [`src/ground_diagnostic/ground_diagnostic.ino`](file:///d:/MIT/Projects/Drone/quad-commutation-testbed/src/ground_diagnostic/ground_diagnostic.ino), we calibrate this with `#define BAT_CALIBRATION_FACTOR 1.0907`:
>
> $$\text{Calibrated Factor} = 1.05 \times \left(\frac{V_{\text{multimeter}}}{V_{\text{measured}}}\right) = 1.05 \times \left(\frac{4.02}{3.87}\right) = 1.0907$$
>
> If your specific multimeter reads slightly different, simply update `#define BAT_CALIBRATION_FACTOR` in the sketch to match your multimeter!

## 5. Ground Station Pinout: ESP32 to OLED & Ra-02

Here is how all the modules on the FlySky transmitter connect to the ESP32 DevKit:

### A. OLED Display (JMD0.96D-1 SSD1306, 4-Pin I2C)
| OLED Pin | ESP32 DevKit Pin | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **VCC** | **3V3** | 3.3V power |
| **GND** | **GND** | Ground |
| **SDA** | **GPIO 23 (D23)** | I2C Data line (mapped via `Wire.begin(23, 22)`) |
| **SCL** | **GPIO 22 (D22)** | I2C Clock line |

### B. Ground LoRa Module (Ra-02 433MHz over SPI)

> [!WARNING]
> Connect Ra-02 power strictly to the **3.3V (3V3)** pin on the ESP32! Connecting 5V directly to the Ra-02 will destroy the SX1278 transceiver.

| Ra-02 Pin | ESP32 DevKit Pin | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.3V** | **3V3** | Clean regulated 3.3V power |
| **GND** | **GND** | Ground reference |
| **NSS / CS** | **GPIO 21 (D21)** | SPI Chip Select |
| **MOSI** | **GPIO 19 (D19)** | SPI Master Out Slave In |
| **MISO** | **GPIO 18 (D18)** | SPI Master In Slave Out |
| **SCK** | **GPIO 5 (D5)** | SPI Clock (mapped via `SPI.begin(5, 18, 19, 21)`) |
| **RST** | **GPIO 15 (D15)** | Hardware Reset line (pulsed LOW for 10ms on startup for clean SX1278 boot) |
| **DIO0** | *Not Connected* | **Leave disconnected!** Polling mode in firmware reads packets over SPI. *(Optional: connect to GPIO 4 / D4 if wiring all pins)* |
| **ANT** | **16.4 cm Wire** | **Soldered directly to the ANT pad on the Ra-02 board** (pointing UP!) |

*(Note: The antenna connects strictly to the Ra-02's center ANT solder pad. Do not connect it to any pin on the ESP32!)*

> [!TIP]
> **Contiguous 4-Pin Ribbon Advantage:**
> On the ESP32 DevKit right rail, pins **D21, D19, D18, D5** sit immediately adjacent to each other in a clean 4-pin row:
> * `D23` -> OLED SDA
> * `D22` -> OLED SCL
> * `D21` -> LoRa NSS (CS)
> * `D19` -> LoRa MOSI
> * `D18` -> LoRa MISO
> * `D5`  -> LoRa SCK
> * `D15` -> LoRa RST
> * `D4`  -> Optional LoRa DIO0 (if wired)
>
> A standard 4-wire DuPont ribbon connector from the Ra-02 SPI lines plugs directly across pins **D21 to D5** as a solid block with zero crossed or separated wires!

## 6. Drone Air Unit Pinout: F405 to ESP32-CAM to Ra-02

On the drone, the AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM uses its dual-core processor to handle MAVLink bridging on Core 0 and live Wi-Fi video streaming on Core 1.

### A. DakeFPV F405 to ESP32-CAM
| F405 FC Pad | ESP32-CAM Pin | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5V** (BEC pad) | **5V** | Powers the ESP32-CAM, camera, and Ra-02 |
| **GND** | **GND** | Common ground reference |
| **T6** (UART6 TX) | **U0R** (GPIO 3) | F405 sends MAVLink telemetry to ESP32 |
| **R6** (UART6 RX) | **U0T** (GPIO 1) | ESP32 sends waypoint commands to F405 |

### B. ESP32-CAM to Air LoRa Ra-02 (SPI on Header 1)
To allow a flat, uncrossed 4-conductor ribbon cable from the Ra-02 SPI lines (`SCK, MISO, MOSI, NSS`), the pins are mapped in exact sequential physical order on Header 1 (Left header, Front View):

| Ra-02 Pin | ESP32-CAM Pin | Physical Header Location | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.3V** | **3.3V** | **Header 2, Pin 1** (Top-Right) | Regulated 3.3V from ESP32-CAM LDO |
| **GND** | **GND** | **Header 1, Pin 2** (Left) | Common ground reference |
| **RST** | **GPIO 12** | **Header 1, Pin 3** (Left) | Hardware Reset line (pulsed LOW on startup) |
| **SCK** | **GPIO 13** | **Header 1, Pin 4** (Left) | SPI Clock (mapped via `SPI.begin(13, 15, 14, 2)`) |
| **MISO** | **GPIO 15** | **Header 1, Pin 5** (Left) | SPI Master In Slave Out |
| **MOSI** | **GPIO 14** | **Header 1, Pin 6** (Left) | SPI Master Out Slave In |
| **NSS / CS** | **GPIO 2** | **Header 1, Pin 7** (Left) | SPI Chip Select |
| **DIO0** | *Not Connected* | — | Polling mode in firmware |
| **ANT** | **16.4 cm Wire** | — | **Soldered directly to ANT pad on Ra-02** (pointing straight UP!) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Why This Physical Pin Mapping is Ideal:**
> 1. **Straight 4-Wire SPI Ribbon (Zero Crossed Wires):**
>    The four SPI lines on the Ra-02 module (`SCK, MISO, MOSI, NSS`) plug straight into **Pins 4, 5, 6, 7** (`IO13, IO15, IO14, IO2`) on the left header of the ESP32-CAM without a single twist or wire cross!
> 2. **Adjacent Ground and Reset:**
>    Right above the SPI block on that same left header sit **Pin 2 (GND)** and **Pin 3 (GPIO 12 / RST)**, keeping almost the entire Ra-02 harness on the left header.
> 3. **Only One Wire from the Right Header:**
>    The only wire crossing from the right side is the single **3.3V power lead (Header 2, Pin 1)**.
> 4. **Safety & Stability:**
>    * Avoids **GPIO 16** (Header 2, Pin 2), which is internally hardwired to PSRAM CS and will crash the camera if touched.
>    * Avoids **GPIO 4** (Header 1, Pin 8), which is hardwired to the blinding white flashlight LED.
>    * Avoids **GPIO 0** (Header 2, Pin 3), which is the camera XCLK clock line and boot strap pin.

## 7. Arduino IDE Setup & Flashing Instructions

### Required Libraries
In Arduino IDE, open **Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries**, and install:
* `LoRa` by Sandeep Mistry (version 0.8.0+)
* `Adafruit SSD1306`
* `Adafruit GFX Library`

---

### Step 1: Bench Testing the Ground Station
Before closing up the case on your FlySky transmitter, upload our diagnostic sketch:
*Sketch location:* [`src/ground_diagnostic/ground_diagnostic.ino`](file:///d:/MIT/Projects/Drone/quad-commutation-testbed/src/ground_diagnostic/ground_diagnostic.ino)

1. Connect the ESP32 DevKit to your PC via Micro-USB / Type-C.
2. Select Board: **ESP32 Dev Module**.
3. Upload the sketch.
4. The OLED display should show:
   - `LoRa (433MHz): OK`
   - `1S LiPo Volts: 3.85V (56%)`
   - If LoRa reports FAIL, recheck your SPI wiring on pins 18, 19, 23, and 5.

---

### Step 2: Uploading Ground Station Flight Code
*Sketch location:* [`src/ground_station_esp32/ground_station_esp32.ino`](file:///d:/MIT/Projects/Drone/quad-commutation-testbed/src/ground_station_esp32/ground_station_esp32.ino)

1. Open `ground_station_esp32.ino`.
2. Upload to the ESP32 DevKit.
3. The OLED will boot up with `GROUND STATION LORA TELEMETRY BOOTING UP...`.
4. It will broadcast as a Bluetooth device named **`Drone_Telemetry`**.

---

### Step 3: Flashing the Air Unit (ESP32-CAM)
*Sketch location:* [`src/air_unit_esp32_cam/air_unit_esp32_cam.ino`](file:///d:/MIT/Projects/Drone/quad-commutation-testbed/src/air_unit_esp32_cam/air_unit_esp32_cam.ino)

1. Connect your FTDI adapter to the ESP32-CAM:
   - FTDI `5V` -> ESP32-CAM `5V`
   - FTDI `GND` -> ESP32-CAM `GND`
   - FTDI `TX` -> ESP32-CAM `U0R` (GPIO 3)
   - FTDI `RX` -> ESP32-CAM `U0T` (GPIO 1)
2. **Connect a jumper wire between `GPIO 0` and `GND`** (puts the ESP32-CAM in flash mode).
3. In Arduino IDE:
   - Board: **AI Thinker ESP32-CAM**
   - Partition Scheme: **Huge APP (3MB No OTA/1MB SPIFFS)**
   - Upload Speed: **115200**
4. Press the small reset button on the ESP32-CAM and hit **Upload**.
5. Once flashing finishes, **disconnect `GPIO 0` from `GND`** and tap reset.

---

## 8. ArduPilot Configuration (Mission Planner)

Because LoRa has a narrower bandwidth window than a direct USB cable, we configure ArduPilot to stream essential telemetry (attitude, GPS, battery, flight mode) without flooding the radio link:

1. Connect the F405 flight controller to Mission Planner via USB.
2. Go to **Config/Tuning -> Full Parameter List**.
3. Set the following parameters (assuming UART6 on `T6`/`R6`):
   - `SERIAL6_PROTOCOL` = **2** (MAVLink2)
   - `SERIAL6_BAUD` = **19** (19200 baud)
   - `SR6_POSITION` = **2** (GPS position & altitude at 2 Hz)
   - `SR6_EXT_STAT` = **2** (Battery voltage and arm state at 2 Hz)
   - `SR6_EXTRA1` = **4** (Attitude / artificial horizon at 4 Hz)
   - `SR6_EXTRA2` = **2** (Speed and HUD at 2 Hz)
   - `SR6_RAW_SENS` = **0** (Disables raw IMU vibration data to save bandwidth)
   - `SR6_RC_CHAN` = **0** (Disables raw servo channel streams)
4. Click **Write Params**.

---

## 9. Operating in the Field

### Connecting Telemetry to Your Phone (QGroundControl):
1. Turn on the Ground Station switch on your FlySky transmitter.
2. On your Android phone, go to **Settings -> Bluetooth** and pair with **`Drone_Telemetry`**.
3. Open **QGroundControl**:
   - Go to **Application Settings -> Comm Links -> Add**.
   - Type: **Bluetooth** -> Select **`Drone_Telemetry`**.
   - Check **Automatically Connect on Start** and click **Connect**.
4. The map will immediately snap to your drone's GPS position, the artificial horizon will level out, and voice alerts will call out battery voltage and satellite lock.
5. **Your phone's 4G/5G mobile internet stays active the entire time**, so satellite map tiles load smoothly as you fly.

### Viewing Close-Range Video & Tactical Cockpit:
1. In your phone or laptop's Wi-Fi settings, connect to **`VORTEX-AIR-RECON`** (Password: `vortex405`).
2. Open Google Chrome, Safari, or any mobile browser and navigate to:
   ```text
   http://192.168.4.1/
   ```
3. You get the full **Tactical FPV Cockpit**:
   - **Continuous Stream**: Smooth MJPEG video running on dedicated Port 81.
   - **Live 90° Camera Tilt Rotation**: Buttons for `0°`, `90° CW`, `180°`, and `270° CW` with persistent orientation saving in browser storage for angled camera mounts.
   - **Searchlight / Flash LED (GPIO 4)**: Instant presets (`OFF`, `25%`, `50%`, `MAX`) and a smooth continuous dimmer slider.
   - **HUD Reticle**: Toggleable tactical targeting crosshair directly on the feed.
   - **Resolution Switcher**: Direct one-click presets from `QVGA 30FPS` up to `HD 720P` and `UXGA 2MP`.
   - **Snapshot**: Instantly downloads high-res still frames.

### Running Safe Autonomous Missions:
A ready-to-fly waypoint mission is available in the repository at:
[`src/missions/park_test_mission.waypoints`](file:///d:/MIT/Projects/Drone/quad-commutation-testbed/src/missions/park_test_mission.waypoints)

* All waypoints are set to **22.0 meters** altitude so the quad easily clears any park trees on autonomous flights.
